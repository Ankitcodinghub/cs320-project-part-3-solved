1 Overview

The stack-oriented programming language of part1 and part2 is fairly low level and difficult to write non-trivial programs for. In this part of the project, your task is to implement a compiler that compiles a OCaml-like high-level programming language into the stack language of part2. More specifically, you must implement a compile function with the following signature.

compile : string -&gt; string

Given a source string written in the high-level language, compile produces a string encoding a semantically equivalent program written in the syntax of the stack language of part2. In other words, given an arbitrary high-level program P, compiling P then interpreting its resulting stack program yields the same trace as interpreting P directly using the operational semantics of the high-level language (Section 3).

The concrete syntax of the high-level language is substantially more complex than the stack language. We provide the parser for the high-level language with the following AST and parser. The parse_prog function parses a string and produces its corresponding high-level AST. Note that the context free grammar presented in Section 2 is not representative of the strings accepted by parse_prog. The input to parse_prog is transformed by the parser (syntax desugaring + variable scoping) to produce a valid expr value. It is these expr values that correspond to the grammar of Section 2.

type uopr =

| Neg | Not

type bopr =

| Add | Sub | Mul | Div | Mod

| And | Or

| Lt | Gt | Lte | Gte | Eq

type expr =

| Int of int | Bool of bool | Unit

| UOpr of uopr * expr

| BOpr of bopr * expr * expr

| Var of string

| Fun of string * string * expr

| App of expr * expr

| Let of string * expr * expr | Seq of expr * expr

| Ifte of expr * expr * expr | Trace of expr let parse_prog (s : string) : expr = ‚Ä¶

3 Operational Semantics

3.1 Configuration of Programs

A program configuration is of the following form.

[T ] s

‚Ä¢ T: (Trace): List of strings logging the program trace.

‚Ä¢ s: (State): Current state of the program. This can be an ‚ü®expr‚ü© or a special Error state.

Examples:

1. [‚ÄúTrue‚Äù :: œµ] let x = 1 inlet y = 2 intrace (x + y)

2. [‚ÄúUnit‚Äù :: œµ] let foo =fun f x -&gt; x inlet y = 2 intrace (foo y)

3. [‚ÄúPanic‚Äù :: ‚Äú1‚Äù :: œµ] Error

3.2 Single-Step Reduction

The operational semantics of the high-level language is similar to OCaml with a reduced feature set. The semantics are given through the following primitive single-step relation.

[T1 ] s1 ‚áù [T2 ] s2

Note: Most of the operational semantics rules are simple but repetitive. Readers familiar with OCaml should already have a good understanding of the high-level language.

3.3 Multi-Step Reduction

A separate multi-step reduction relation [T1 ] s1 ‚áù [T2 ] s2 is defined to compose together 0 or more single-step reductions.

The rules for deriving the multi-step relation are given as follows.

StarStep

StarRefl

[T ] s ‚áù‚àó [T ] s

‚Ä¢ StarRefl: A program configuration ‚Äúreduces‚Äù to itself in 0 steps.

‚Ä¢ StarStep: Multi-step can be extended with a single-step if their end state and starting state match.

3.4 Values

We refer to a special subset of expressions as values. In particular, values can be characterized by the following grammar. We can see here that integer constants, boolean constants, unit constants and functions are considered values. Basically, values are expressions which can not be reduced further.

‚ü®value‚ü© ::= ‚ü®int‚ü© | ‚ü®bool‚ü© | ‚ü®unit‚ü©

| fun ‚ü®var‚ü© ‚ü®var‚ü© -&gt; ‚ü®expr‚ü©

Note: We use the v variable to range over values. In other words, all instances of v are required to be values.

[T ] v1 &gt;= v2 ‚áù [‚ÄúPanic‚Äù :: T ] Error [T1 ] m &gt;= n ‚áù [T2 ] Error

The meaning behind these rules can be summarized as follows. GteError3

[T1 ] m ‚áù [T2 ] Error

[T1 ] v &gt;= m ‚áù [T2 ] Error

‚Ä¢ GteInt: Interpret syntactic v1 &gt;= v2 as the greater-than-equal comparison v1 ‚â• v2 if applied to integers v1 and v2.

‚Ä¢ GteExpr1: Structurally reduce the left-hand side of greater-than-equal if it is not a value.

‚Ä¢ GteExpr2: Structurally reduce the right-hand side of greater-than-equal if it is not a value. This rule additionally requires the left-hand side to already be a value. Basically, the arguments of greater-than-equal must be evaluated from left to right in order for GteExpr2 to be applicable.

‚Ä¢ GteError1: Applying greater-than-equal to values of incorrect types results in Error and panic trace.

‚Ä¢ GteError2: A greater-than-equal expression reduces to Error if its left-hand side reduces to Error.

‚Ä¢ GteError3: A greater-than-equal expression reduces to Error if its right-hand side reduces to Error. Similarly to GteExpr2, the GteError3 rule requires the left-hand side to already be a value.

The meaning behind these rules can be summarized as follows.

‚Ä¢ EqInt: Reduce syntactic v1 = v2 to true if they are mathematically equal v1 = v2.

‚Ä¢ NeqInt: Reduce syntactic v1 = v2 to false if they are mathematically unequal v1 Ã∏= v2.

‚Ä¢ EqExpr1: Structurally reduce the left-hand side of equality if it is not a value.

3.7 Expressions

Let-In Expression

Let-in expressions allow one to bind values to variables.

LetExpr

LetVal

[T ] let x = v in m ‚áù [T ] m[v/x]

LetError

[T1 ] m ‚áù [T2 ] Error

[T1 ] let x = m in n ‚áù [T2 ] Error The meaning behind these rules can be summarized as follows.

Hint: In the stack language, we can use commands Bind and Lookup to achieve the same effect as substitution.

‚Ä¢ LetExpr: Structurally reduce the bound expression m1 if it is not a value.

‚Ä¢ LetError: A let-in expression reduces to Error if its bound expression m reduces to Error.

Function Application

Function application applies (possibly recursive) functions to value arguments.

AppExpr1 AppExpr2 AppFun

[T ] (fun f x -&gt; m) v ‚áù [T ] m[(fun f x -&gt; m)/f,v/x]

AppError1 v1 is not of the form (fun f x -&gt; m)

[T ] v1 v2 ‚áù [‚ÄúPanic‚Äù :: T ] Error

AppError2

[T1 ] m ‚áù [T2 ] Error

[T1 ] m n ‚áù [T2 ] Error

AppError3

[T1 ] m ‚áù [T2 ] Error

[T1 ] v m ‚áù [T2 ] Error

The meaning behind these rules can be summarized as follows.

‚Ä¢ AppFun: An applied function is reduced by substituting argument v for variable x in function body m. Furthermore, the function itself is substituted for variable f in m. The notation m[(fun f x -&gt; m)/f,v/x] denotes an expression obtained from m by replacing all instances of variable x with value v and all instances of variable f with function

(fun f x -&gt; m). The substitution of f for (fun f x -&gt; m) facilitates recursion by allowing the function to refer to itself through variable f.

Hint: Given an arbitrary closure ‚ü®f,Vf,C‚ü© in the stack language, the Call command will evaluate its local commands C using the extended local environment f ‚Ü£ ‚ü®f,Vf,C‚ü© :: Vf. Can the extension f ‚Ü£ ‚ü®f,Vf,C‚ü© to the local environment be utilized to achieve the same effect of substituting f for (fun f x -&gt; m)?

‚Ä¢ AppExpr1: Structurally reduce the left-hand side of an application expression if it is not a value.

‚Ä¢ AppExpr2: Structurally reduce the right-hand side of an application expression if it is not a value. This rule additionally requires the left-hand side to already be a value. Basically, the sub-expressions of application expressions must be evaluated from left to right in order for AppExpr2 to be applicable.

‚Ä¢ AppError1: Applying a non-function value to a value argument results in Error and panic trace.

‚Ä¢ AppError2: An application expression reduces to Error if its left-hand side reduces to Error.

‚Ä¢ AppError3: An application expression reduces to Error if its right-hand side reduces to Error. Similarly to AppExpr2, the AppError3 rule requires the left-hand side to already be a value.

Sequence Expression

The sequence expression allows one to compose 2 expressions together for sequential evaluation.

SeqExpr SeqError

SeqVal[T1 ] m ‚áù [T2 ] Error

[T ] v; m ‚áù [T ] m[T1 ] m; n ‚áù [T2 ] Error

The meaning behind these rules can be summarized as follows.

‚Ä¢ SeqVal: Once the left-hand side of a sequence expression has been fully evaluated, evaluate the right-hand side. Notice that the value of the overall sequence expression is determined by the right-hand side expression m because v on the left-hand side is discarded.

‚Ä¢ SeqExpr: Structurally evaluate the left-hand side of a sequence expression. While the left-hand side of a sequence expression will not impact the value of the overall expression, traces made by the left-hand side will persist even after the left-hand side is discarded by SeqVal.

‚Ä¢ SeqError: A sequential expression reduces to Error if its left-hand side reduces to Error.

If-Then-Else Expression

If-then-else expression facilitates program branching on boolean conditions.

IfteTrue

[T ] iftruethen n1 else n2 ‚áù [T ] n1

IfteFalse

[T ] iffalsethen n1 else n2 ‚áù [T ] n2

IfteExpr

[T1 ] m1 ‚áù [T2 ] m2

[T1 ] if m1 then n1 else n2 ‚áù [T2 ] if m2 then n1 else n2

IfteError1 v is not a bool

[T ] if v then n1 else n2 ‚áù [‚ÄúPanic‚Äù :: T ] Error

IfteError2

[T1 ] m ‚áù [T2 ] Error

[T1 ] if m then n1 else n2 ‚áù [T2 ] Error The meaning behind these rules can be summarized as follows.

‚Ä¢ IfteTrue: An if-then-else expression reduces to its then-branch if its condition is true.

‚Ä¢ IfteFalse: An if-then-else expression reduces to its else-branch if its condition is false.

‚Ä¢ IfteExpr: Structurally evaluate the condition of an if-then-else expression.

‚Ä¢ IfteError1: Attempting to branch on a non-boolean value results in Error and panic trace.

‚Ä¢ IfteError2: An if-then-else expression reduces to Error if its condition reduces to Error.

Trace Expression

A trace expression logs the value of its argument to the program trace T.

TraceExpr

TraceVal [T1 ] m1 ‚áù [T2 ] m2

[T ] trace v ‚áù [toString(v) :: T ] () [T1 ] trace m1 ‚áù [T2 ] trace m2 The meaning behind these rules can be summarized as follows.

TraceError

[T1 ] m ‚áù [T2 ] Error

[T1 ] trace m ‚áù [T2 ] Error

‚Ä¢ TraceVal: If trace is applied to value v, prepend the string representation of v to T and reduce to unit value ().

‚Ä¢ TraceExpr: Structurally evaluate the argument of trace.

‚Ä¢ TraceError: A trace expression reduces to Error if its argument reduces to Error.

Given an arbitrary value v in the high-level language, the string obtained from toString(v) is the same string representation of v‚Äôs corresponding stack language value. The following equations illustrate the strings expected for typical inputs.

toString(123) = ‚Äú123‚Äù (1)

toString(true) = ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù (2)

toString(false) = ‚ÄúFalse‚Äù (3)

toString(()) = ‚ÄúUnit‚Äù (4)

toString(fun abc x -&gt; m) = ‚ÄúFun&lt;abc&gt;‚Äù (5)

Notice that these equations are missing the symbol case of the stack language. This is because variables in the high-level language are always bound by let-expressions or function parameters and never appear in isolation. In fact, the parse_prog function is raise an UnboundVariable exception and fail to parse if this criteria is not met. Consider the high-level program let x = 1 in trace x where trace is applied to a let-bound variable. The expression reduces to trace 1 through the LetVal rule which means that trace is no longer applied to a variable. The string ‚Äú1‚Äù can now be successfully logged by the TraceVal rule.

4 Compilation

In this section we demonstrate how to compile a simple high-level program into the stack language. Consider the program (trace 1;2) ‚Äì (tracetrue;3) in the high-level language. Informally, the following evaluation steps happen in order.

1. Begin evaluation of the left-hand side of subtraction expression (trace 1;2) ‚Äì (tracetrue;3).

2. Begin evaluation of the left-hand side of sequence expression trace 1;2.

3. Evaluation of trace 1 logs ‚Äú1‚Äù to the trace and the sequence expression becomes ();2.

4. Now that () is a value, ();2 reduces to 2.

5. The left-hand side of 2 ‚Äì (tracetrue;3) is now an integer value, so evaluation of the right-hand side begins.

6. Begin evaluation of the left-hand side of sequence expression tracetrue;3.

7. Evaluation of tracetrue logs ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù to the trace and the sequence expression becomes ();3.

8. Now that () is a value, ();3 reduces to 3.

9. Our subtraction expression is now 2 ‚Äì 3 which can be reduced one last time to ‚àí1.

To capture the evaluation process of the high-level program, we maintain an compilation invariant: for a high-level expression, the value expected of its direct evaluation is always on top of the stack after interpreting its compiled version. We can see how this invariant comes into play during the compilation of the program given above. Compilation begins by recursively compiling the left and right and sides of the subtraction expression. So we now have 3 subtasks: first compile

(trace 1;2), next compile (tracetrue;3), finally subtract their results.

To compile (trace 1;2), it is easy to see that this corresponds to the stack commands Push 1;Trace;Pop;Push 2;. Notice that trace 1 is compiled to Push 1;Trace; which logs ‚Äú1‚Äù and puts Unit on the stack. Our compilation invariant holds as the value expected of directly evaluating trace 1 is on top of the stack. Next, the sequence operator (_;_), which is compiled to Pop, removes Unit from the stack. This implements the value discarding behavior of sequence expressions. Finally the constant 2 is compiled to Push 2. The resulting stack after executing Push 1;Trace;Pop;Push 2 is exactly 2 so our compilation invariant is maintained for the entire (trace 1;2) expression.

Next, (trace true;3) is compiled to Push True;Trace;Pop;Push 3;. Following the same reasoning as before, the invariant is maintained as the expected value 3 is on top of the stack after interpreting these commands.

Now that we have recursively compiled the sub-expressions of our original subtraction expression, we are left with the task of composing together the compiled commands and performing subtraction. Suppose we append the compiled commands together in the following way where the commands of (trace 1;2) occur before the commands of (tracetrue;3).

Push 1;Trace;Pop;Push 2; PushTrue;Trace;Pop;Push 3; (1)

Interpreting these stack commands results in stack [3 :: 2 :: œµ] and trace [‚ÄúTrue‚Äù :: ‚Äú1‚Äù :: œµ]. In order for our compilation invariant to hold for all of (trace 1;2) ‚Äì (tracetrue;3), the integer value ‚àí1 must be on top of the stack after evaluating its compiled commands. If we haphazardly append Sub to the end of (1), the resulting command list (2) will produce [1 :: œµ] which violates the compilation invariant since -1 is not on top of the stack.

‚úó Push 1;Trace;Pop;Push 2;PushTrue;Trace;Pop;Push 3; Sub; (2)

Suppose we append the compiled commands together in the following way where the commands of (trace true;3) occur before the commands of (trace 1;2). Interpreting these stack commands results in stack [2 :: 3 :: œµ] and trace [‚Äú1‚Äù :: ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù :: œµ]. Although the stack is in the correct state for performing Sub, the order of strings in the trace is incorrect as it logs ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù before logging ‚Äú1‚Äù.

‚úó PushTrue;Trace;Pop;Push 3; Push 1;Trace;Pop;Push 2; (3)

The correct way to perform subtraction here is to insert a Swap command before the Sub command in (2). After the Swap command, the stack is [2 :: 3 :: œµ] and the trace is [‚ÄúTrue‚Äù :: ‚Äú1‚Äù :: œµ]. At this point, performing Sub results in -1 on top of the stack so our invariant is preserved. Furthermore, the order of strings in the trace is correct.

‚úì Push 1;Trace;Pop;Push 2;PushTrue;Trace;Pop;Push 3; Swap; Sub; (4)
